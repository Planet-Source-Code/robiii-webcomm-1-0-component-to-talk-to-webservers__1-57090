## WebComm 1\.0: Component to talk to Webservers


</div>

### Description

This object can be used to "talk" to webservers. Use it to request HTML documents, RSS feeds, Binary files (like images or zipfiles) and use it to query webservers using GET or POST methods. It contains an XMLDoc property wich allows easy acces to any XML that a webserver might have returned and a SaveToFile method which allows you to easily save responses. All data (and even response headers) is made available in easy to use properties. You can even set your own request headers. The object is fully documented in a PDF file.
 
### More Info
 
Although this object tries some variations, some version of the XMLHTTP object should have been installed. This is the case on most newer systems, but might require the user to download the latest MSXML version (http://www.microsoft.com/xml)
